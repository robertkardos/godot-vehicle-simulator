# Godot Vehicle Simulator (WIP)
This is a work in progress attempt at making a semi-realistic vehicle simulator in Godot.

I've used this guide for the raycast-based suspension and lateral forces: https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/wolfes-simulator-workshop-devlog.396400/

I'm constantly looking for examples, tutorials and other information regarding this topic, if you have something you could share with me, please do reach out and send it to me.

## STATUS:
The next part I want to implement is applying torque on the wheels.


Language: GDScript
